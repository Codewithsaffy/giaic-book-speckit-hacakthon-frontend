# Chapter 4: URDF for Humanoid Robots

This chapter focuses on creating detailed robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format), with specific emphasis on humanoid robot structures. You'll learn to model complex kinematic chains, define physical properties, and integrate models with control systems.

## What You'll Learn

- URDF fundamentals and XML structure
- Complex humanoid kinematic modeling
- Joint types and constraints for humanoid robots
- Visual and collision geometry optimization
- Practical applications and complete examples

## Sections in This Chapter

1. [Introduction](./intro.md) - Overview of humanoid robot modeling
2. [Understanding URDF XML Structure](./urdf-structure.md) - URDF format and components
3. [Modeling Humanoid Kinematics](./modeling-kinematics.md) - Kinematic chains and hierarchies
4. [Joint Types and Constraints](./joint-types.md) - Joint configurations for humanoids
5. [Visual and Collision Geometries](./visual-collision-geometries.md) - Geometry optimization

## Prerequisites

- Completed previous chapters
- Understanding of robot kinematics
- Basic XML knowledge helpful

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll have comprehensive knowledge of ROS 2 and humanoid robot modeling. You'll be ready to tackle advanced topics in the subsequent modules of this curriculum.
