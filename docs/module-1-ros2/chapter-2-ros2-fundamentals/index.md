# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to Chapter 2 of the ROS 2 module! This chapter covers the fundamental concepts that form the backbone of ROS 2 systems, specifically tailored for humanoid robotics applications.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you'll explore:

- **Node Architecture**: Understanding the fundamental computational units in ROS 2
- **Messaging Systems**: Topics, publishers, subscribers, and Quality of Service (QoS) profiles
- **Service and Action Communication**: Synchronous requests and long-running tasks
- **Parameter Management**: Configuration without code recompilation
- **Launch Systems**: Coordinated startup of complex robot systems

## Why These Concepts Matter

ROS 2 fundamentals are crucial for humanoid robotics because they provide the infrastructure for coordinating multiple sensors, actuators, and control systems that must work together seamlessly. Understanding these concepts will enable you to build robust, maintainable, and safe humanoid robot applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, make sure you have:

- A working ROS 2 installation
