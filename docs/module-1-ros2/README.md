# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module serves as the foundational component of the humanoid robotics curriculum, establishing ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the "nervous system" that enables communication, coordination, and control across robotic systems.

## Overview

Module 1 provides comprehensive coverage of ROS 2 concepts, from basic installation and setup to advanced AI integration and humanoid robot modeling. Students will learn to build robust, scalable robotic applications using ROS 2's distributed architecture.

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2
- What is ROS 2?

- Installation and Setup
- ROS 2 Ecosystem and Tools

### Chapter 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Nodes - Building Blocks of ROS
- Topics - Publisher-Subscriber Communication
- Services - Request-Response Communication
- Actions - Goal-Based Communication
- Parameters - Runtime Configuration
- Launch Files and System Management

### Chapter 3: Python AI to ROS Integration
- Python ROS 2 Client Libraries
- AI Model Integration with ROS 2
