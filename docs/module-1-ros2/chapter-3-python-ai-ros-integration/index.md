# Chapter 3: Python AI to ROS Integration

This chapter bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and robotics by demonstrating how to integrate Python-based AI systems with ROS 2 infrastructure. You'll learn to deploy machine learning models, process sensor data, and create intelligent robotic behaviors.

## What You'll Learn

- Python-ROS 2 integration using rclpy
- AI model deployment within ROS 2 nodes
- Computer vision integration with robotic systems
- Machine learning pipeline construction
- Effective communication patterns between AI and control systems

## Sections in This Chapter

1. [Introduction](./intro.md) - Overview of AI-ROS integration
2. [Connecting Python AI Frameworks with ROS](./bridging-python-ros.md) - PyTorch and TensorFlow integration
3. [Creating Custom ROS Messages for AI Data](./custom-message-types.md) - Custom message design
4. [Building Real-time Data Pipelines](./realtime-data-pipelines.md) - Efficient data processing
5. [Handling Latency and Synchronization](./latency-synchronization.md) - Timing constraints and sync

## Prerequisites

- Completed Chapters 1 and 2
- Basic understanding of Python and AI concepts
- Familiarity with machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be able to integrate AI systems with ROS 2 infrastructure. Proceed to Chapter 4 to learn about robot modeling using URDF.
