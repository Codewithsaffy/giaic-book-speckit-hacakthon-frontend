# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where we establish the foundational framework for humanoid robotics development using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2). This module serves as the "nervous system" of your robotic applications, providing the communication infrastructure, coordination mechanisms, and control systems necessary for complex robotic behaviors.

## Module Overview

ROS 2 is the next-generation middleware for robotics applications, designed to address the limitations of the original ROS framework while providing enhanced capabilities for modern robotics challenges. In this module, you will learn to:

- Install and configure ROS 2 development environments
- Design and implement distributed robotic systems
- Integrate AI systems with robotic infrastructure
- Model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Apply best practices for robust and scalable robotic applications

## Learning Path

This module is structured in four progressive chapters:

1. **Introduction to ROS 2**: Establish foundational concepts and environment setup
2. **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Master core communication patterns and system management
3. **Python AI to ROS Integration**: Bridge artificial intelligence with robotic systems
4. **URDF for Humanoid Robots**: Model complex humanoid robot structures

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming experience in Python and C++
- Fundamental understanding of robotics concepts
- Linux command-line familiarity
- Basic knowledge of software development practices

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you will have created:
- A complete ROS 2 system with multiple interconnected nodes
- AI-integrated robotic applications
- Detailed URDF models for humanoid robots
- Scalable and maintainable robotic software architectures

## Next Steps

Begin with Chapter 1 to establish your ROS 2 development environment and understand the fundamental concepts that will power your humanoid robotics applications throughout this curriculum.
