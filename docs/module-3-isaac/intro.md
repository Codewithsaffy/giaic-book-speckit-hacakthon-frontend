# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive platform for developing GPU-accelerated robotics applications. Isaac provides tools for simulation, perception, navigation, and manipulation that leverage NVIDIA's GPU computing capabilities for advanced AI in robotics.

## Overview

The NVIDIA Isaac platform consists of several key components:
1. **Isaac Sim**: GPU-accelerated simulation environment
2. **Isaac ROS**: GPU-accelerated perception and control nodes
3. **Isaac Navigation**: Advanced navigation stack optimized for GPU acceleration
4. **Isaac Manipulation**: GPU-accelerated manipulation and grasping

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure the NVIDIA Isaac platform
- Understand GPU-accelerated physics simulation with Isaac Sim
- Implement GPU-accelerated perception using Isaac ROS
- Apply VSLAM and real-time depth perception techniques
- Configure navigation systems for humanoid robots using GPU acceleration

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- Access to an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Understanding of GPU computing concepts
- Familiarity with ROS/ROS2

## Hardware Requirements

NVIDIA Isaac requires specific hardware for optimal performance:
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX series or better (recommended RTX 3080 or higher)
- **Memory**: 16GB+ system RAM, 10GB+ GPU memory
- **CUDA**: CUDA 11.0 or higher
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or Windows 10/11 with WSL2

Let's begin by exploring the Isaac ecosystem and its components.
